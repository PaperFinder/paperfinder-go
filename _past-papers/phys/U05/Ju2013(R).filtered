A Neutrons are released B No harmful radiation is produced C The binding energy per nucleon increases D The total mass increases (Total for Question 5 = 1 mark) (Total for Question 6 = 1 mark) *P43324A0324* 3 Turn over PMT7 An object is hung from a vertical spring and undergoes undamped simple harmonic motion It is correct to say that there are no changes in the A elastic potential energy of the oscillating system B gravitational potential energy of the oscillating system C kinetic energy of the oscillating system D total energy of the oscillating system (Total for Question 7 = 1 mark) 8 A car is travelling over a rough road surface At low speed the ride is very bumpy with the car and its occupants suffering large amplitude vertical oscillations However, when the car is driven at a higher speed the ride gets smoother the car’s suspension oscillates at a greater frequency than its natural frequency (Total for Question 8 = 1 mark) 9 The gravitational field strength at the surface of the Earth is 9 8 N kg–1 A satellite is orbiting at a height above the ground equal to the radius of the Earth the car crushes the bumps and makes the road smoother there is a greater amount of damping in the car’s suspension A B C D This is because at the higher speed the car leaves the ground and misses the bumps exemplar DRAFT The gravitational field strength, in N kg–1, at this height is A 0 0 B 2 5 C 4 9 D 9 8 (Total for Question 9 = 1 mark) 4 *P43324A0424* exemplar DRAFT PMT10 The absolute temperature scale is a theoretical scale proposed by Lord Kelvin On this scale, zero is the temperature at which A all gases become liquids B an ideal gas would exert no pressure C D water freezes the Celsius temperature is
