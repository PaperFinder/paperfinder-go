in an infinite universe light from very distant stars should make the whole of the visible sky bright To see how much distant stars contribute to light reaching the Earth, the universe can be modelled as a uniform distribution of identical stars If this universe is divided into a series of thin concentric ‘shells’ centred on Earth, there will be a certain number of stars on each shell The diagram

flux received at the Earth from the stars on each shell is the same (b) One explanation proposed for why the night sky is not bright was that there is too much dust in space for distant stars to be seen However, such dust would absorb radiation and heat up (i) Space is estimated to be at a temperature of 2 7 K Use this value to calculate the radiant power emitted per m2 of a body at this
