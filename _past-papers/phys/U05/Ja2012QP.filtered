carbon-14 undergoes decay with a half-life of 5730 years While an organism is living, it takes in carbon from the atmosphere and the ratio of carbon-14 to the stable isotope carbon-12 in the organism is constant After death the ratio changes, as the carbon-14 continues to decay but no more carbon is taken in This is the basis of radiocarbon dating Archaeologists have used radiocarbon dating to pinpoint the date of construction of Stonehenge, an ancient stone circle in south west England The archaeologists unearthed dead organic material from under the stones and sent a sample of it to Oxford University for analysis Scientists at the university determined that the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in the sample was only 60% of that found in living organisms (a) Explain what is meant

their cores This process generates heat which pushes the star outwards This outward pressure is matched by the gravitational forces pulling the star inwards This maintains an equilibrium, allowing the star to radiate away vast amounts of energy for long periods of time Our Sun has been in this state for about 4 5 billion years Eventually the star runs out of hydrogen to fuse, and so changes occur which allow fusion of helium to form heavier elements Massive stars can produce elements up to iron in their cores by fusion Once a star’s core has been converted into iron no further fusion can take place and the rapid collapse of the star results in a supernova explosion The remnant of the supernova may be a neutron star or black hole, depending upon the remnant’s mass Hydrogen burning Helium
