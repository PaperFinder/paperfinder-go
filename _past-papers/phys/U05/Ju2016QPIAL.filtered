A alpha radiation because it is very ionising B alpha radiation because it is high energy C gamma radiation because it is very penetrating D gamma radiation because it has a very short wavelength 3 Americium is a radioisotope that decays by emitting alpha particles The difference in mass in MeV/c2 between an americium nucleus and the products of the decay is
