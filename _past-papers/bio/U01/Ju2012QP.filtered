disease (CVD) is responsible for many deaths One cause of CVD is atherosclerosis The photograph below shows a section through an artery with a plaque (atheroma) from a patient with CVD X Y Lumen Plaque (a) Calculate the increase in the thickness of the artery wall where the plaque is located Take your measurements along the line labelled X and Y Show your working Answer *P39509A01124* 11 Turn over PMT (b) The plaque often increases in size and can block the artery If the artery supplying blood to the heart becomes blocked, blood no longer flows to the heart muscle cells Shortly after the loss of blood flow, heart muscle cells stop contracting and start to die In the heart muscle cells, energy (ATP) is made available from respiration The graph below shows how the energy (ATP) available

prescribe drugs to treat patients who are over 80 and have high blood pressure (a) (i) Give the name of the type of drug that is used to treat high blood pressure (ii) Explain why many patients, who are over 80 and have high blood pressure, are routinely prescribed with these drugs *P39509A01924* 19 Turn over PMT (b) A study was carried out to investigate the benefit of treating patients who are over 80 and have high blood pressure Patients were randomly put into one of two groups, A and B Each group contained 2000 patients Patients in group A were given two tablets each containing a different drug Patients in group B were given two tablets neither of which contained a drug The systolic and the diastolic pressure of each patient was measured The systolic pressure is the maximum pressure when the heart contracts and the diastolic pressure is the minimum pressure when the heart relaxes The blood pressure of all patients was recorded over a period of five years The mean pressures were then calculated The graph below shows the results of this study a P k / s e r u s s e r p d o o b n a e M l 24 – 22 – 20 – 18 – 16 – 14 – 12 – 10 – 8 – 6 – 4 – 2 – 0 – Start of
