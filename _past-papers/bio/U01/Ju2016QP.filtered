concern for sailors These sailors had no access to fresh fruit and vegetables during long sea voyages Sauerkraut (fermented cabbage) contains vitamin C Ships stored sauerkraut because it does not decompose easily Vitamin C is water soluble and is found in cabbage cells These cells also contain an enzyme, ascorbic acid oxidase, that can oxidise vitamin C The table below shows the vitamin C content of sauerkraut and cabbage, treated in different ways Food Treatment Vitamin C content / mg per 100 g Sauerkraut freshly made Sauerkraut stored for 3 months Cabbage raw Cabbage Cabbage added to

saturated or unsaturated The formula for a saturated fatty acid is CnH2nO2 The formula for an unsaturated fatty acid, with one double bond, is CnH(2n–2)O2 The table below shows the melting points of
