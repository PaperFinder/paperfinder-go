These sailors had no access to fresh fruit and vegetables during long sea voyages Sauerkraut (fermented cabbage) contains vitamin C Ships stored sauerkraut because it does not decompose easily Vitamin C is water soluble and is found in cabbage cells These cells also contain an enzyme, ascorbic acid oxidase, that can oxidise vitamin C The table below shows the vitamin C content of sauerkraut and

presence of the allele (a) in place of the normal allele (A) results in a change of one amino acid in the haemoglobin molecule This mutation changes the properties of haemoglobin and can result in red blood cells becoming less flexible and blocking small blood vessels The frequency of the recessive allele (a) is much higher in populations in West Africa than in populations in Northern Europe People in West Africa have a much higher risk of being infected with malaria parasites and developing severe anaemia than people in Northern Europe People who are heterozygous for sickle cell anaemia have sufficient amounts of normal haemoglobin to prevent severe anaemia One theory suggests that the malaria parasite (Plasmodium sp ) causes red blood cells with any modified haemoglobin to rupture This occurs before the parasite can reproduce *(a) In West Africa, the average life expectancies of people with genotypes AA, Aa or aa are different (i) Using the information above, give an explanation for
