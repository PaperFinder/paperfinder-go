and then mark your new answer with a cross 1 (a) Read through the following passage on the blood clotting process, then write on the dotted lines the most appropriate word or words to complete the passage The blood clotting process starts when cell fragments called release molecules of These molecules are which catalyse the conversion of into , in the presence of calcium ions As a result, fibrinogen is converted into fibrin and blood cells are trapped to form the clot 2 *P39884A0224* A protein consists of a chain of amino acids joined together by bonds In the space below, draw a
