investigated the effect of ethanol on the permeability of beetroot cell membranes In this investigation, 10 identical pieces were cut from one beetroot One piece of beetroot was left in 10 cm3 of 30% ethanol for 20 minutes at 20 °C After 20 minutes, the piece of beetroot was removed and the intensity of the colour of the ethanol solution was measured using a colorimeter This was repeated with other pieces of beetroot that were left in ethanol concentrations of 0%, 50%, 70% and 100%, at 20 °C The student repeated this investigation with the other five pieces of beetroot at the same

of the first gene therapy treatments approved in Europe, one child from each of three families with a history of MLD, was treated As a result of this treatment the children were able to talk at an age when some of their untreated brothers and sisters were unable to talk MLD is associated with a recessive allele (a) Two parents, who are physically unaffected by the disorder, have already had one child with the disorder Using a suitable genetic diagram, calculate the probability that the next child of these parents will also be affected by this disorder exemplar DRAFT probability *P44486A0724*

cold and there is little shelter After nine days of feeding, the mass of a harp seal pup can increase by about 300% Using information from the table, suggest why a harp seal pup increases in mass more quickly than a human baby (b) The composition of human milk can be affected by the diet of the mother The table below shows the concentration of eight fatty acids found in milk from two different
