piece of beetroot was left in 10 cm3 of 30% ethanol for 20 minutes at 20 °C After 20 minutes, the piece of beetroot was removed and the intensity of the colour of the ethanol solution was measured using a colorimeter This was repeated with other pieces of beetroot that were left in ethanol concentrations of 0%, 50%, 70% and 100%, at 20 °C The student repeated this investigation with the other

the first two years of life, can prevent a child learning how to walk and talk In one of the first gene therapy treatments approved in Europe, one child from each of three families with a history of MLD, was treated As a result of this treatment the children were able to talk at an age when some of their untreated brothers and sisters were unable to talk MLD is associated with a recessive allele
