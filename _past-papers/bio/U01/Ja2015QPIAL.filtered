Some questions must be answered with a cross in a box If you change your mind about an answer, put a line through the box and then mark your new answer with a cross 1 The nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, are involved in cell replication and protein synthesis (a) DNA and RNA are large polynucleotides formed by joining many mononucleotides together 2 Put a cross in the box that completes each of the following statements (i) The sugar in a mononucleotide of RNA is A deoxyribose B glucose C ribose D ribulose (ii) In a DNA double helix, the two strands are held together by A covalent bonds between bases B covalent bonds between sugar molecules C hydrogen bonds between bases D hydrogen bonds between sugar molecules (iii) The base present in RNA but not present in DNA is A cytosine B guanine C thymine D uracil *P45028A0228* PMT (iv) The mononucleotides in a molecule of mRNA are joined together by A disulphide bridges B glycosidic bonds C peptide bonds D phosphodiester bonds (v) The complementary base that pairs with guanine is A adenine B cytosine C guanine D uracil (b) Meselson and Stahl carried out an experiment that demonstrated the semiconservative replication of DNA (i) Explain the meaning of the term semiconservative replication *P45028A0328* 3 Turn over PMT (ii) Meselson and Stahl grew bacteria in a medium containing one isotope of nitrogen These bacteria were then transferred to a second medium containing a different isotope of nitrogen The DNA extracted from the bacteria was then separated according to its density Draw bands on tubes B and C to show the results of this experiment DNA from bacteria grown in first medium DNA from bacteria allowed to replicate once in second medium DNA from bacteria allowed to replicate twice in second medium A B C

molecules can be used during exercise (a) Triglycerides are a type of lipid formed when three fatty acid chains combine with a glycerol molecule (i) Put a cross in the box that completes the following statement Each fatty acid chain is joined to glycerol by A an ester bond formed by a condensation reaction B an ester bond formed during hydrolysis C a peptide bond formed by a condensation reaction D a peptide bond formed during hydrolysis (ii) Describe how the structure of a saturated lipid differs from that of an unsaturated lipid (b) Describe the structure of glycogen 6 *P45028A0628* PMT (c)

obtained from lipids and carbohydrates (Total for Question 2 = 9 marks) *P45028A0728* 7 Turn over PMT3 Atherosclerosis is a potentially serious condition that affects millions of people each year There is a link between saturated fats in the diet and atherosclerosis (a) Read through the passage on atherosclerosis, then write on the dotted lines the most appropriate words to complete the passage When atherosclerosis develops, fatty deposits called form These deposits cause affected blood vessels called to harden and , reducing the supply of to the tissues This can cause a heart attack or, if the is affected, it can cause a stroke (b) It has been suggested that high blood cholesterol levels can cause cardiovascular disease (CVD) Coronary heart disease is one type of CVD The graph below shows the relationship between mean blood cholesterol level and the risk of death from coronary heart disease in two groups of people t r a e h y r a n o r o c m o r f h t a e d f o k s i R s t
