answer with a cross 1 Cardiovascular diseases are very common in the Western World (a) Many cardiovascular diseases result from atherosclerosis 2 Place a cross the following statements in the box next to the correct word or words to complete each of (i) Atherosclerosis usually results from the formation of plaques inside A arteries B capillaries C veins D ventricles (ii) The plaques begin to form after damage to A endothelial cells B epidermal cells C red blood cells D white blood cells (iii) These cells may be damaged due to A blood flowing slowly under low pressure B blood flowing quickly under low pressure C blood flowing slowly under high pressure D blood flowing quickly under high pressure (iv) The plaque consists of A carbohydrate deposits B fatty deposits C plasma deposits D protein deposits *N37480A0224* PMT (v) The presence of a plaque in the vessels supplying blood to the brain could result in A cancer B a heart attack C kidney damage D a stroke *N37480A0324* 3 Turn over PMT (b) A clinical trial was carried out to investigate the effect of a drug on the volume of plaques in patients with atherosclerosis Forty patients with atherosclerosis were divided into two groups of twenty Each patient had the volume of their plaque determined One group was the control group and the treatment group took the drug daily for two months At the end of the two months, the volume of the plaque in each patient was determined again The mean change in volume of the plaque was calculated The results of the clinical trial are shown in the graph below 3 m m l / e u q a p f o

show (ii) Suggest two reasons why the results of this trial do not indicate that this drug could be useful in treating patients with atherosclerosis 1 2 (Total for Question 1 = 9 marks) *N37480A0524*

structure of capillaries and veins If the statement is correct, place a tick ((cid:57)) in the appropriate box and if the statement is incorrect, place a cross ((cid:56)) in the appropriate box Type of blood vessel Valves present along the length of the vessel Wall consists of a single layer of cells Endothelial cells present Capillary Vein (b) Semilunar valves and elastic fibres are found in the aorta For each of these structures, describe its location in the aorta and explain its function Semilunar valves Location Function Elastic fibres Location Function (Total for Question 2 = 9 marks) 6

two strands of mononucleotides Each of these strands is twisted around the other, forming a Each mononucleotide consists of a pentose sugar called , a base and a In each strand, the mononucleotides are held together by bonds The two strands are held together by complementary base pairing Adenine bonds with and cytosine bonds with The name of the bond that forms between these bases is a bond A DNA molecule that is composed of 34% adenine will be composed of % cytosine (Total for Question 3 = 8 marks) *N37480A0724* 7 Turn over PMT 4 Many animals have a heart and circulatory system (a) Give one reason why many animals have a circulatory system (b) The diagram below shows a section through a mammalian heart On the diagram, draw arrows to show the flow of blood into and through the right side of the heart during one beat of the heart Right side Left side (c) Explain why a mammalian heart is divided into a right side and a left side (Total for Question 4 = 6 marks) 8 *N37480A0824* PMT 5 Thalassaemia is the name of a group of inherited blood disorders that affect the body’s ability to produce haemoglobin in red blood cells Red blood cells are produced in bone marrow Oxygen in the lungs binds to haemoglobin and is carried to the cells of the body to be used in respiration Beta thalassaemia is the result of a mutation in the gene coding for the
