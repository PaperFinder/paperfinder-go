several mechanisms (a) Read through the following passage that describes some of these mechanisms, then write on the dotted lines the most appropriate word or words to complete the passage Some molecules move across a cell surface membrane by passing down a concentration gradient, through the phospholipid bilayer The movement of some polar molecules across the membrane involves carrier and channel molecules When this movement occurs down a concentration gradient, the process is called and when it occurs against a concentration gradient the process is called Energy in the form of is used in the movement of molecules against a concentration gradient 2 *P38170A0228* (b) A student wanted to sweeten some strawberries, so she sprinkled some sugar on top of them, one hour before eating them The student noticed that the sugar that she had sprinkled on them was no longer visible and that there was some juice at the bottom of the bowl PMT Appearance on adding sugar Appearance one hour after adding sugar The student thought that the juice was the sugar dissolved in water and that the water had come from the fruit In order to test this hypothesis, she weighed some fresh strawberries and sprinkled them with sugar One hour later she rinsed off the juice and reweighed the strawberries The mass of the strawberries before adding the sugar was 77 g The mass after rinsing off the juice
