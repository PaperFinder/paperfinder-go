Obesity is a significant risk factor in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (a) One way of estimating if a person is obese is to find their Body Mass Index (BMI) Body Mass Index is calculated using the formula below BMI = Mass in kilograms )2 height in metres ( The table below provides the range of BMI values for different categories of people Category BMI range Very severely
