out in Finland A total of 572 patients with high blood pressure and ranging in age from 25 to 66 were included in the trial Patients were divided into two groups One group was treated with a drug called Captopril and the second group was treated with a drug called Propranolol The health of these patients was studied for six years The number of patients experiencing a heart attack or a stroke during this six-year period was recorded The results of the clinical trial are shown in the table below Drug treatment Captopril Propranolol Percentage of patients experiencing a heart attack (%) 3 9

Scientists have genetically modified potato plants to increase their concentration of vitamin C (a) In one experiment, the modified plants produced extra quantities of an enzyme called dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) in their leaves and tubers The graph below shows the vitamin C concentration in the leaves and tubers from control plants and from DHAR-modified plants 1 – g l o m
