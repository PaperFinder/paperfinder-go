The Avogadro constant is the number of A grams of any element which contains 6 02 × 1023 atoms of that element B C atoms contained in one mole of any element atoms contained in one mole of any monatomic element D particles (atoms, molecules or ions) required to make one gram of a substance (Total for Question 3 = 1 mark) 2 *P39306A0224* PMT4 In an experiment to determine the enthalpy change of combustion of an alcohol, a spirit burner containing the alcohol was weighed, lit and placed under a copper can containing a known volume of water The temperature rise of the water was measured and the burner re-weighed The enthalpy change calculated from the results was much less exothermic than the value reported in the literature Which of the following factors is most likely to be the cause of this error? A Heat loss around the side of the copper can B The use of a thermometer with a range of 0 – 110 °C rather than 0 – 50 °C C The use of a measuring cylinder for measuring the water rather than a pipette D Evaporation of the alcohol during the weighing (Total for Question 4 = 1 mark) 5 The standard enthalpy changes of formation of carbon dioxide and of methanoic acid are íN-PRO–1DQGíN-PRO–1 respectively Calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction H2(g) + CO2(g)oHCOOH(l) A íN-PRO–1 B íN-PRO–1 C N-PRO–1 D N-PRO–1 (Total for Question 5 = 1 mark) 6 For which of the following changes is the value of
