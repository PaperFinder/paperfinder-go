Housing Market Extract 1 Record fall in house prices House prices fell by 13 4% between October 2007 and September 2008, the fastest rate for more than 50 years, according to Halifax Bank, Britain’s biggest mortgage lender The average price of a house fell from £198,533 to £172,108 over the period Rising unemployment has reduced consumer confidence and new mortgages (house purchase loans) have become difficult to obtain Banks have become very cautious over whom they lend to after experiencing losses from bad debtors Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight, predicted that the average house price will continue to fall to around £134,000 by 2010 due to concerns over the length of the economic downturn The recent cuts in interest rates may have little impact as housing remains unaffordable for many people (Source: adapted from: ‘House prices falling at fastest rate for 50 years, says the Halifax’ by Myra Butterworth, The Telegraph, 10th October 2008 ) Figure 1: Average

of housing market The number of first-time buyers has fallen dramatically over recent years according to Halifax Bank It estimated that just 300,000 first-time buyers entered the housing market in 2007, down from 532,000 in 2002 Difficulties remain in obtaining mortgages and larger cash deposits are often required for these buyers, exceeding 10 per cent of the property value First-time buyers are now more likely to be in their thirties than their twenties and to buy flats rather than terraced houses However, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors believes that conditions for first-time buyers should improve over the next two years Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist, said “there is huge pent-up demand from first-time buyers and should house prices continue to drop, many will be ready to enter the market ” (Source: adapted from ‘First-time buyers priced out of market’ by Patrick Collinson, The Guardian, 22nd December 2007 ) Extract 3 Regional house prices Despite falling house prices, regional differentials are expected to remain Average house prices in Greater London are much higher than for other regions This appears to be caused by several factors, for example, variations in regional earnings and availability of land to build on Differences in regional unemployment may also be a factor The government intends to permit the building of more than 1 1 million homes in the south-east by 2016, despite strong opposition from local councils and environmental groups (Source: adapted from ‘The housing crisis hits home’ by Alexander Frean & Alexandra Blair, The

prices The price of rice increased dramatically from $400 to $1,000 per tonne between January and May 2008, sparking food riots and protests in many countries, ranging from Haiti in the Caribbean to Pakistan in Asia The soaring price of rice is due to rising incomes in developing countries such as China, and population growth in India and Indonesia; severe flooding and droughts in rice growing regions have also had an effect – the most recent example being a cyclone which devastated Myanmar in May 2008 In Thailand, one of the world’s largest rice producers, farmers have responded by raising supply Fields which have been unused for many years are now being ploughed and rice seed planted Farmers are even contemplating three or four harvests a year rather than the usual one or two Many have given up jobs in towns and cities to return to the countryside and cash in from growing rice (Source: ‘Fear of rice riots as surge in demand hits nations across the Far East’ by Leo Lewis, The Times, 8th April 2008 ) Extract � Government intervention in the rice market Governments in several rice growing countries such as India, Vietnam, Egypt and Cambodia have imposed restrictions on rice exports in order to switch supplies to their own domestic consumers This should make rice more affordable However, it could cause problems in the long term since rice farmers will not benefit from the high global price that consumers in developed countries are prepared to pay It will affect the incentive to produce The governments are also considering a buffer stock scheme which aims to adjust market supply between good and poor harvests and so guarantee rice at an affordable price However, buffer stock schemes have failed spectacularly in other commodity markets, for example, coffee, cocoa and tin These have reflected problems in funding and excess production The millions of rice growers in Asia could make it unworkable (Source: ‘Thai cartel idea outrages rice consumers’ by Carl Mortishead,
