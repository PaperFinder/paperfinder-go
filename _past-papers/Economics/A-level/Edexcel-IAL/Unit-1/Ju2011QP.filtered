been highly unstable over the past year It collapsed from a record level of $8,940 in April 2008 to $2,871 per tonne by December of that year The steep drop in price followed lower global economic growth, especially from China The decrease in demand was most noticeable in the motor vehicle and construction sectors which use vast amounts of the metal Its impact was to reduce profits and share prices of major copper mining companies such as Chile’s Antofagasta However, by March 2010, copper prices recovered to almost $7,500 per tonne This followed disruption to supply in several major copper mines in Chile due to a severe earthquake and a series of strikes by miners, demanding a 7 5% pay rise The global economy has also recovered from the recession and China is expected to achieve an economic growth rate of 9 5% in 2010 The dramatic fluctuations in copper prices have led some analysts to propose a guaranteed minimum price scheme Source: Adapted from ‘Miners dragged lower as price of copper tumbles’, Peter Stiff, The Times, 19th December 2009 5 10 PMTPMT 27 *P38817A02740* Turn over Extract 2 Proposals for a major copper mine in Bristol Bay, Alaska Rising copper prices has made it profitable to open new mines The mining companies Northern Dynasty and Anglo-American Corporation have jointly proposed creating North America’s largest open pit mine at Pebble Mill in Bristol Bay, Alaska It would be 3 2 kilometres long and 610 metres deep It would also involve building the largest dam in the world to hold back the vast amount of toxic waste created in the mining process The dam, made of earth rather than concrete, would be 220 metres high and 7 kilometres long It takes a thousand tonnes of copper ore to produce just one tonne of copper metal However, Bristol Bay is home to the world’s most productive wild salmon fishery and there is concern that pollution from the mines would destroy the $400 million a year fishing and canning industries, as well as having a negative impact on tourism The area already has a history of earthquakes and severe flooding which increase the chances of pollution from the mining project The local native communities strongly oppose the scheme and the planning enquiry is expected to take several years Source: Adapted from Pebble mine – Bristol Bay Alaska www renewableresourcescoalition org/projectoutline htm www
