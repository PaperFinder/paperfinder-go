*P53240A01136* Turn over 11 Extract 1 Fluctuations in cocoa prices The price of cocoa has risen to record levels following poor harvests in West Africa Between November 2014 and December 2015 cocoa prices increased from £1 840 to £2 230 per tonne Strong winds from the El Nino weather effect led to drought conditions damaging the cocoa crop Traders have also purchased extra cocoa in advance for fears of a shortage next year, raising prices further according to Edward George at Ecobank, a major African bank Three quarters of global production remains concentrated in just a few West African countries such as Ivory Coast, the world’s biggest producer Cocoa trees take five years to grow to maturity and the availability of suitable land for expansion is severely limited Cocoa is subject to enormous price fluctuations This creates instability in income, employment and investment among cocoa farmers The governments of West Africa are considering a buffer stock scheme which aims to adjust supply between good and poor harvests to stabilise the cocoa market However, such a scheme failed some thirty years ago because of funding problems and difficulties in organising the thousands of cocoa farmers (Source: adapted from ‘El Nino pushes up price of chocolate’, Robin Pagnamenta, The Times, 30 November 2015) Extract 2 Chocolate prices set to rise Cocoa is a key ingredient in making chocolate products The increase in cocoa prices is almost certain to lead to a rise in the price of premium brands of chocolate such as Godiva and Lindt, which contain high levels of cocoa However, for standard chocolate brands such as Mars and Cadbury, higher cocoa prices may have little impact on the price of chocolate bars The producers may seek to avoid raising prices by reducing the size of the chocolate bars or altering the ingredients In the long term, as emerging markets continue to grow, demand for cocoa from China and India is likely to increase Consumers in these countries are developing a strong taste for chocolate (Source: adapted from ‘El Nino pushes up price of chocolate’, Robin Pagnamenta, The Times, 30 November 2015) 5 10 15 5 *P53240A01236* 12 (a) With reference to

Extract 1 Growth in UK bottled water sales The consumption of bottled water has continued to grow at a time of falling demand for other types of soft drink such as fruit juices, smoothies and fizzy colas The growth in demand for bottled water reflects successful promotions and more people trying to follow healthier lifestyles The potential for further growth is very positive: annual bottled water consumption per head in the UK is 41 litres, which is far below the West European average of 119 litres The recycling of bottles and cans has increased rapidly over the past decade; many containers are now produced with 25–50% recycled materials Of the bottled water consumed in the UK around 73% is bottled in the UK, including most supermarket own brand water 15% comes from France, including premium brands such as Badoit and Perrier (Source: adapted from www britishsoftdrinks com/PDF/2013UKsoftdrinksreport) 5 10 *P53240A02536* Turn over 25 Extract 2 Environmental damage from bottled water Water is a precious resource Governments should ensure the sustainability of safe water supplies for the benefit of all people and the natural environment The use of bottled water is harmful to the environment Three litres of water are used directly or indirectly in the production of one litre of bottled water The majority of bottles are made of plastic and end up in landfill sites rather than being recycled Furthermore, vast amounts of plastic waste never reach the recycling plants but end up in the oceans, killing fish and birds who mistake it for food It takes up to a thousand years for plastic to decompose and so the problem is set to get worse Bottled water is often transported hundreds of miles from its origin to shops and consumers, at considerable carbon cost By contrast, tap water only takes a little energy to pump along pipelines into homes Bottled water is also expensive and consumers can pay anything up to 10 000 times more than if they just drank tap water Studies have shown that tap water is generally just as clean and healthy as bottled water, if not more so Furthermore, over half of the bottled water in the UK comes from purified tap water It is time for the UK Government to intervene by increasing the indirect tax on bottled water (Source: adapted from http://www guardian co uk/commentisfree/2007/jul/10/ timetocapbottledwater?
