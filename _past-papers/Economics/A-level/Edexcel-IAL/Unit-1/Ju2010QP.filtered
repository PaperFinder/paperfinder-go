a car is the second largest expenditure item for consumers after buying a house Not surprisingly, the economic downturn has caused a drastic fall in demand for new cars New car sales fell by 21 8% in the first three months of 2009 in response to a 1% fall in real income over the same period Thousands of UK motor vehicle manufacturing jobs are likely to be lost this year Nissan announced 1,200 redundancies in January and Toyota halved the number of shifts on its production lines Several car companies have reduced wages, for example, Honda has reduced wage rates by 10% Other companies have frozen pay to avoid compulsory redundancies BMW and Ford closed their motor vehicle factories temporarily to reduce stockpiles of cars General Motors, the owner of Vauxhall, may close its two UK plants in Luton and Ellesmere Port unless significant government grants or loans are provided These factories are in areas of relatively high unemployment Source: Adapted from ‘Fears for 40,000 jobs in British car trade as Toyota goes into red’, by Leo Lewis and Tom Bawden, The Times, 23rd December 2008 and SMMT fact sheet smmt co uk Extract � Government car scrappage scheme In the 2009 Budget, Chancellor Alistair Darling announced that motorists who scrap a car more than ten years old will receive a £2,000 grant when purchasing a new vehicle The scheme follows similar moves by major European countries, including France and Germany However, the motor vehicle companies have to contribute £1,000 to the subsidy and the remaining £1,000 is paid by the government The UK scheme will cost just £300 million and will end when the money runs out By contrast, the German government has allocated £4 49 billion, boosting new car sales by 40% The car scrappage scheme is likely to boost the sale of smaller models such as the Toyota Yaris, but will be of little benefit to larger and more expensive vehicles such as Jaguar The scheme has also been criticised for benefiting foreign manufacturers since eight out of ten cars bought in the UK are imported However, the government claims that many of these imported cars have UK-made parts and the scheme will help UK car retailers The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders urged the government to provide more help for the industry by reducing fuel taxes and making it easier for consumers to get car loans (Source: ‘Budget 2009:
