by rapid economic growth in China and speculative buying by traders intent on making quick profits The major oil exporters were unable to respond by increasing production, due to a prolonged period of under-investment in refining capacity The high oil prices have led to an increase in oil exploration and investment in other regions Many small oil fields in the North Sea that were once too small, too deep or too dangerous to explore are now being developed, but this could take many years to come on stream Brazil and Azerbaijan have also invested heavily to raise future production (Source:

Extract � The impact of rising fuel prices on the airline industry There are fears that rising oil prices will worsen the global recession Many industries are suffering, especially airlines Hardly a week goes by without an airline company going bankrupt due to uncertainty over the costs of fuel and falling passenger demand Douglas McNeill, of Blue Oar investments, believes that more than fifty European airlines are under threat as the industry faces its worst ever trading environment However, Willie Walsh, chief executive of BA, said “It’s a positive thing if some of these airlines go out of business as it will take capacity out of the market Look at Alitalia – it should not be allowed to continue in business It is propped up by state subsidies from the Italian government” Airlines are finding it difficult to raise fares when passenger demand is falling Similarly, it is hard to cut costs in a safety conscious industry (Source: ‘Final call for more than fifty airlines’, David Robertson, Rachel Sylvester and Alice Thomson, The Times, 2nd August, 2008 ) Extract 3 The price of petrol UK petrol prices increased by more than 33 per cent between the start of 2004 and July 2008, from 86 pence to 115 pence per litre – the highest in the European Union This was due to the rising price of oil (from which petrol is derived) and higher taxes on petrol The surge in fuel prices led to growing protests across the UK as road haulage companies and motorists complained that the tax on petrol was too high Many small transport firms faced ruin The Freight Transport Association, a pressure group for road haulage firms, urged the government to cut taxes on road fuel In response, the government has cancelled a planned tax increase of 2 pence per litre However, since July 2008 falling oil prices has taken some pressure off the government Petrol prices have come back down to 89 pence per litre (Source: www petrolprices com 2009) 5 10 5 10 M35967AGCEASEconomicsJan20111 11

scheme could reduce congestion on Britain’s roads by fifty per cent according to a government report on ‘The future of Britain’s transport system’ published today The Chair of the report, Sir Rod Eddington, said charging motorists could reduce carbon emissions and save the economy up to £28 billion in wasted time delays by 2025 It recommended that motorists pay more at peak times and in congested areas, up to £1 30 per mile The funds raised could then be re-invested into improving the nation’s road and rail network, particularly in heavily congested areas A national scheme would operate by installing satellite boxes in each car, with varying rates set at a ‘per mile’ basis for all roads depending on congestion and time of day Sir Rod Eddington commented: ‘‘I am in no doubt that by setting prices to reflect both the congestion and environmental costs of travel, the transport system can be used more efficiently; it will support UK competitiveness and will contribute to reduced emissions I believe there is no attractive alternative to road pricing Without a widespread scheme by 2015, Britain will require very significantly more road transport infrastructure’’ (Source: ‘Report calls for road pricing to ease congestion’, by James Sturcke, The Guardian, 1st December, 2006 ) Extract � Case against road pricing The government has postponed plans for a national road pricing scheme following an online petition with 1 8 million signatures objecting to it The Minister for Transport, Ruth Kelly, stated that such a scheme raised concerns over privacy and fairness Road pricing would affect motorists in different ways according to their income There is also a huge cost involved and some uncertainty over the effectiveness of implementing a nationwide road pricing programme Currently, more than a million motorists evade paying road tax Instead, the government favours car-sharing lanes, a tax on workplace parking and converting hard shoulders on motorways into extra lanes According to the Department for Transport, converting hard shoulders into motorway lanes costs just £6 million per kilometre compared to £25 million per kilometre for widening schemes A recent pilot scheme which used the hard shoulder on the M42 motorway proved to be successful Road pricing has not been completely abandoned The government intends to introduce smaller schemes for selected lanes on motorways by 2015 (Source: ‘Road pricing scheme stalled’, by Dan Milmo, The Guardian, 4th March 2008 ) 5 10 15 5 10 15 M35967AGCEASEconomicsJan20123 23 03/09/2009 10:58:53 PMTPMT �4
